# pairs2
R function used to examine pairwise relationships among variables in a dataframe. Given a matrix/dataframe with n columns, it returns an n x n matrix plot consisting of scatterplots, mosaic plots, and/or boxplots as appropriate. P-values assoicated with tests of each pairwise relationship are printed on each plot, colored red if significant at the pre-specified significance level.
